Student Exam Score Prediction

This project predicts student exam scores using a Machine Learning model built in Python.
The goal is to analyze student-related factors and estimate exam performance based on historical data.
The project includes data analysis, model training, and a user-friendly web interface for predictions.

**Project Overview**
**Dataset:** Kaggle Student Performance Dataset
